Web2Executable
==============

Uses node-webkit to generate "native" apps for already existing web apps.

Requires the pyside library and python 2.X to run. If you want to replace the icon in the Windows Exe's, this will do it automatically with the latest code if you have PIL or Pillow installed. I've only tested the code on python 2.7.3-2.7.5, so I can't speak about any lower version, but it should work as long as PySide is supported.

If you have an idea for a feature, please create a new issue with a format like this: "Feature - My Awesome New Feature", along with a good description of what you'd like the feature to do.

If you got some value out of using my app, consider donating a dollar to keep me caffeinated :)

###CMD

[Windows 7+ Download](http://www.mediafire.com/download/r9rawa9qorlfa79/Web2ExeWin-CMD.zip)

[Mac OS X 10.6+ download](http://www.mediafire.com/download/esyz3z3ij0qrt64/Web2ExeMac-CMD.zip)

[Ubuntu 14.04 download](http://www.mediafire.com/download/vet95whim6g8x55/Web2ExeLinux-CMD.zip)

###GUI

####Mac OS X

[Mac OS X 10.7+ download - v0.1.17b](http://www.mediafire.com/download/i1h1y3nlabu1217/Web2ExeMac-v0.1.17b.zip)

You can just put the app where ever you want and double click to run it.

####Windows

[Windows 7+ download - v0.1.17b](http://www.mediafire.com/download/6ui6ru96pinr7o1/Web2ExeWin-v0.1.17b.zip)

Double click the Web2Exe.exe file inside the extracted folder.

####Linux

[Ubuntu 14.04 - v0.1.17b](http://www.mediafire.com/download/fpkyd9v9m3k26hf/Web2ExeLinux-v0.1.17b.zip)

Give the executable permissions to execute and then run it:

```
chmod +x web2exe
./web2exe
```

It's probably better for linux users to install the requirements and run the python script as instructed below.


Getting Started
---------------

###Using Prebuilt Binaries

When using the prebuilt binaries for Windows, Mac, or Ubuntu, there are NO dependencies or extra applications needed. Simply download Web2Exe for the platform of your choice, extract, and double click the app/exe/binary to start. This applies to both the command-line version and the GUI version.

### Run from Python Source

####GUI

Install dependencies **PIL or Pillow** for icon and icns exporting.

Initiate submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Run with:

```
python main.py
```

It's a pretty simple app. Just point it the the directory that your web application lives, customize the options (the two marked with a star are the only ones required) and then choose your export options. The app will export under YOUR_OUTPUT_DIR/YOUR_APP_NAME. 

####Command line interface

Dependencies: configobj (install with pip) and Pillow if you want icon replacement (not necessary)

Run the command_line.py with the --help option to see a list of export options. Optionally, if you don't want to install python, there are builds for Mac and Windows in the command_line_builds folder of this repository.

Example usage (if using the prebuilt binary, replace `python command_line.py` with the exe name):

```
python command_line.py /var/www/html/CargoBlaster/ --main html/index.html --export-to linux-x64 windows mac --width 900 --height 700 --nw-version 0.10.5
```

###GUI Instructions

To use Web2Exe:
  1. Choose a project folder with at least one html or php file. The name of the export application will be autogenerated from the folder that you choose, so change it if you so desire.
  2. Modify the options as needed.
  3. Choose at least one export platform and then the Export button should enable (as long as the field names marked with a star are filled out and all files in the fields exist).
  4. Click the export button and once it's done, click the "Open Export Folder" button to go to the folder where your exported project will be.

Features
--------

- Cross platform to Mac, Windows, Linux
- Working media out of the box (sound and video)
- Easy to use and straightforward
- Streamlined workflow from project -> working standalone exe
- Same performance as Google Chrome
- Works with Phaser; should work with other HTML5 game libraries
- Export web applications to all platforms from your current OS
- Ability to specify a node-webkit version to download
- Automatic insertion of icon files into Windows exe's or Mac Apps by filling out the icon fields as necessary
- A command line utility with functionality equivalent to the GUI. Useful for automated builds.


Future Plans
------------

Since the UI is getting quite cluttered, and the current design has limitations in terms of size, I'm working on recreating Web2Executable in NW.js with an enhanced UI using the opensource bootflat project. This will take a bit of time, but it will greatly simplify the build process, and it will have the added bonus of Web2Executable being able to bootstrap itself.

I will take all the bugs and feature requests from the github repo into consideration and probably add a few new features while I'm at it.

Planned New Features
--------------------

- The ability to add external files to the project
- Kiosk mode
- Project name separate from manifest name
- Minifying JS and HTML
- Compression using UPX
- Info.plist editing support for Mac OS X
- Ability to edit credits.html
- A slick new UI and name to go with it


FAQ
---

### How do I include external files?

You must provide support for this yourself using javascript and nodejs. You can get the path of the current executable with `path.dirname( process.execPath );` and then load files relative to that path. 

### When exporting to Linux, I get an error about libudev.so.0

This is an known issue with nw.js/node-webkit. See [here](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/The-solution-of-lacking-libudev.so.0) for information on how to work around this issue.

### How do I use option X?

All of the options for node-webkit are documented in node-webkit's manifest file specification. It is located [here](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/Manifest-format).

### What is the downloads folder for and where should I keep it?

The downloads folder is where Web2Exe stores the node-webkit versions in zip or tar format. This location should be chosen as a central location, because Web2Exe will reuse the files to create executables every time the export button is pressed. It will also save time by not having to redownload the node-webkit files over and over.

The Web2Executable/files/downloads folder is a good place to keep your downloads or any place that **isn't your project's directory**.

### Where is the default downloads location and how can I change it back?

For right now, the default location is in Web2Executable/files/downloads (Web2Executable.app/Contents/MacOS/files/downloads for Mac OSX).

This location is stored on a by project basis, so it will load what you have set for a particular project from the package.json file. Right now, the only way to change it back to the default is to open the package.json file with a text editor and remove the download_dir option from it.

### How do I use the icon replacement?

The icon replacement works by filling out the fields "Window Icon", "Exe Icon", or "Mac Icon". If "Window Icon" is filled out and the others aren't, Web2Exe will automatically use this field instead of "Exe Icon" or "Mac Icon" depending on if you export to Mac or Windows.

If you fill "Exe Icon" out, this will be used to replace the icon inside the node-webkit exe from the default compass icon if you export to Windows. Only pngs and jpegs are supported right now.

If you fill out "Mac Icon", this will convert the icon from png or jpeg to icns and copy it into the Mac app folder (or just copy if the icon is already in icns format). Of course, this is only when exporting to Mac.

### Why don't you replace icons for Linux?

Linux executables don't use icons, so there's nothing to replace. If you want to set an icon for when the app is running for Linux, simply fill out the "Window Icon" field.
